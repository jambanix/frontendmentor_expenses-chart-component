## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

This was a good challenge and a problem I hadn't come across before. It was a bit of a headache trying to get the heights on the chart container and respective bars to marry up, and took a lot of tweaking; in the real world I would no doubt use a chart library, but this was still good to get an understanding of things

### Continued development

I will continue doing the challenges to gain more exposure to different problems I may encounter in the real world
